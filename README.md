# Calculating-Stars-Temperatures
This project a partner and I used Planck's and Wien's laws to estimate the temperatures of stars. 
This was done in Rstudio and our findings were written into an essay using Quarto. 
Wrote multiple functions using equations from Planck's and Wien's laws to calculate temperature with our given data.
